- Cleans and filters to real countries using ISO3 codes.
- Groups by **Category** (developed vs developing) and **Region**.
- Plots median trends over time for:
  - Renewables share
  - Greenhouse gas emissions
  - Primary energy consumption
- Shows a 2021 snapshot of **Energy per Capita** by country.
- Aggregates regional totals for **Solar**, **Hydro**, and **Wind** electricity.

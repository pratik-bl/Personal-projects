# Data Driven Analysis of Agricultural Sustainability: Insights from Emissions, Land-Use Efficiency, and Sustainability Prediction for Top Agricultural Producers

Single-notebook analysis using agricultural land area and agro-food CO₂ emissions. The notebook cleans both datasets, aligns them by country and year, explores trends, builds tidy summary tables, and saves a few clear charts.

## Datasets
Place these files in `data/`:
- `data/Agrofood_co2_emission.csv`
- `data/Transformed_Sorted_Agricultural_Land_Area.csv`

If your filenames differ, update the first cell in the notebook.

## What the notebook does
1) **Load and clean**
   - Reads both CSVs
   - Standardises column names and types
   - Normalises country names and ensures `country` and `year` keys exist
   - Handles missing values with simple and transparent rules

2) **Transform**
   - Derives indicators such as:
     - CO₂ per hectare (agro-food emissions divided by agricultural land area)
     - Optional per-capita metrics if population is available
   - Optionally winsorises or clips extreme outliers

3) **Join and summarise**
   - Joins datasets on `country` and `year`
   - Creates grouped summaries (for example by region or income group if available)
   - Produces correlation and trend tables

4) **Visualise**
   - Time-series trends of emissions and land area
   - Scatter of CO₂ vs land area with a fitted line
   - Ranked leaderboard for the latest year

5) **Export**
   - Saves cleaned and joined tables to `artifacts/`
   - Saves figures to `reports/figures/` (if `plt.savefig(...)` is used)

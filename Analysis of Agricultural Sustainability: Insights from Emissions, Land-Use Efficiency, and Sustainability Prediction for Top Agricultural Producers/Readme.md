# Data Analytics Project

Single-notebook analysis using agricultural land area and agro-food CO₂ emissions data. The notebook cleans both datasets, explores trends, and builds tidy summary tables and charts.

## Datasets used
Place these files in `data/raw/`:

- `Agrofood_co2_emission.csv`
- `Transformed_Sorted_Agricultural_Land_Area.csv`

If your filenames differ, update the first cell in the notebook.

## What the notebook does
1) **Load and clean**
   - Reads both CSVs
   - Fixes types, trims column names, standardises country and year
   - Handles missing values and outliers

2) **Transform**
   - Normalises units where needed
   - Creates per-capita or per-hectare indicators
   - Aligns country and year keys for joining

3) **Join and summarise**
   - Left or inner join on `country` and `year`
   - Builds grouped summaries by region or income group
   - Produces correlation and trend views

4) **Visualise**
   - Time-series trends of CO₂ emissions vs agricultural land area
   - Scatter plots with fitted lines
   - Ranked leaderboards by latest year

5) **Export**
   - Saves cleaned and joined tables
   - Saves key figures to `reports/figures/`
